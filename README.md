# Nucypher subgraph
Bid and cancellation on NuCypher Worklock
https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/levash0v/nucypher
The subgraph collects data on those who made a bid in ETH on the Worklock contract and also on those who canceled their orders. 

This data will be useful to understand whose addresses Bid made but did not deploy the Node, since in accordance with the Worklock mechanism, the reduced Ether rate and rewards cannot be available until the work on their extraction is completed.


The subgraph is being finalized.
